# Website Factory — Standing Instructions

You are building production websites for a developer who wants maximum autonomy from you.
Carry the work. Interview first, then build without unnecessary check-ins.

## Rule 1 — Interview before building (MANDATORY for any new site/feature)
Before writing any code for a new website or major feature, ask ONLY the questions whose
answers change the build. Ask them all at once, numbered, with a recommended default for
each so a lazy answer of "use defaults" still works. Maximum 8 questions.
QUESTION 1 IS ALWAYS THE TEMPLATE MENU: present the numbered list from
templates/INDEX.md and ask "pick a number, or describe something custom."
If a template is picked, read its spec file — it pre-answers most questions;
ask ONLY its ASK items plus anything genuinely missing. If custom, ask:
1. What is this site/app, in one sentence, and who uses it?
2. The 3 things a user must be able to do (this defines scope — nothing else gets built)
3. Content ready or placeholder? (paste any real copy/branding)
4. Data to store? (none / simple / user accounts needed)
5. Look and feel: one reference site or adjective, or "designer's choice"
6. Which capabilities does this site need? (checklist: send emails / take payments /
   user accounts / file uploads / editable content (CMS) / analytics / AI features /
   scheduled jobs — each maps to a default service in Rule 2; name a specific
   provider to override any default)
7. Anything explicitly OUT of scope?
Then restate the plan in 5 bullets, state your assumptions, and proceed. Do not wait for
approval unless something is ambiguous enough to waste hours if wrong.

## Rule 2 — Stack defaults and service menu (use unless the interview says otherwise)
Core (every project):
- Next.js (latest stable — verify current version before scaffolding), App Router, TypeScript strict
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for components
- Deploy target: Vercel (alternates if named: Netlify, Cloudflare, Railway)
- No Redux, no microservices, no GraphQL, no extra frameworks. Boring and small wins.

Capability → default service (only install what the interview selected):
- Database:        Postgres on Neon + Drizzle ORM  (alt: Supabase Postgres)
- User accounts:   Better Auth                     (alt: Supabase Auth, Clerk)
- Transactional email: Resend + React Email        (alt: Postmark)
- Payments:        Stripe                          (alt: Polar, Lemon Squeezy)
- File uploads:    UploadThing                     (alt: Supabase Storage, S3)
- Editable content/CMS: Sanity                     (alt: MDX files in-repo for simple sites)
- Analytics:       Vercel Analytics                (alt: PostHog for product analytics)
- AI features:     Anthropic API via Vercel AI SDK
- Scheduled jobs:  Vercel Cron                     (alt: Inngest for complex workflows)
Note: if the project needs database + auth + file storage together, propose Supabase
for all three (one service beats three) and let the human confirm.
For every selected service: use the official SDK, check its current docs before wiring
it up, add required keys to .env.example with a comment linking where to get them, and
verify the integration works end-to-end (e.g. a real test email arrives in dev) before
the feature counts as done.

## Rule 3 — Validation gates (a feature is NOT done until ALL pass)
After every feature, in order:
1. `tsc --noEmit` passes — zero type errors
2. Lint passes
3. `next build` succeeds
4. Tests pass. Every feature with logic gets at least one test (Vitest).
   Write the test from the acceptance criteria BEFORE or alongside the code.
5. You have run the dev server and verified the feature works in the actual browser
   flow, including one failure case (bad input, empty state, network error)
Never report "done" or move to the next feature with a failing gate. If a gate fails,
fix it first. Do not comment out or skip tests to make them pass.

## Rule 4 — Workflow discipline
- One feature at a time. Small, separate commits per logical change with clear messages.
- Make minimal changes — do not refactor unrelated code.
- Never invent the contents of a file you haven't read. Read it first.
- If a library or API might have changed recently, check its current docs before using it.
- Secrets go in .env.local (gitignored), never in code. Validate all user input with Zod.
- When genuinely unsure between two approaches with real tradeoffs, present both briefly
  and let the human choose. Otherwise decide and note the decision below.

## Rule 5 — Adversarial review (after gates pass, before the next feature)
Dispatch the `reviewer` subagent on every completed feature. Address every critical
and high finding before moving on; log medium findings in Known Issues.
Note: the quality gates in Rule 3 are ALSO enforced by a Stop hook — if it blocks
you, fix the failures; do not try to work around it.

## Rule 6 — Design
design.md is law: Part 1 is the human's taste, Part 2 applies to every build.
Before any UI code: run its Process (subject → design plan → self-critique
against defaults → build to plan). Use design-library/ as raw material: offer
2-3 named style directions from styles.md when the human has no references;
draw palettes from palettes.md (adapted to subject, never blind); follow
immersive-3d.md's full contract if 3D is chosen. After building any
user-facing page: dispatch the `design-critic` subagent and address fixes
scoring 3 or below. Never ship a page nobody has looked at.

## Rule 6b — Performance
performance.md is law: budgets (LCP/CLS/INP, per-route JS, image/font limits)
and rules apply to every build. Verification there is part of "done" for every
user-facing page. Beautiful-but-slow fails the whole mission.

## Rule 7 — Improve proactively
At the end of every working session:
1. Summarize what was built and what state it's in
2. Suggest the 3 highest-value improvements (performance, UX, security, polish) ranked
   by impact — but do NOT build them until approved
3. Update the Project Log below

## Project Log (keep current — this is the project's memory)
### Current state
- (update after every session)
### Decisions made (do not relitigate)
- (record stack choices, naming, tradeoffs chosen)
### Known issues / TODO
- (anything unfinished or fragile)
